# Repository Issue Tracker (React + TypeScript + Vite)
Welcome to the Repository Issue Tracker! This project is a dynamic web application designed to fetch and display issues from its own GitHub repository. Built with React, this application serves as a testament to my journey in mastering React and applying best practices in real-world projects.

## About The Project
The Repository Issue Tracker was born out of a desire to practice with React, training my capabilities and to challenge myself in managing state, handling API requests, and rendering dynamic content. This application specifically aims to:

- Fetch and list issues from this GitHub repository.
- Provide a clean and user-friendly interface to browse through the issues.
- Utilize modern React features such as Hooks and Context API for efficient state management.


Through the development of this application, I aimed to refine my understanding of React and enhance my skills

## Features
*   **React**: For building the user interface and managing the application state.
*   **Axios**: Utilized for making HTTP requests to the GitHub API.
*   **Lodash**: For debounce functionality, optimizing search feature performance.
*   **React Spinners**: To provide visual feedback during data loading phases.
